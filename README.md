# Hockey-Monster

This site is using MONGO, Express, D3, and NodeJS to create a web app that will serve users customized fantasy hockey advice based on the link they provide to the interface. It's still a work in progress.

Player database is populated by making calls to the NHL API, and then analysis is done on the players to give a score corresponding to how well they perform. 

This data is then served up as a chart, using D3.

The goal is to, for a micropayment using moneybutton, allow users to have their specific team analyzed and the scoring algorithm adpated to their specific league settings.
